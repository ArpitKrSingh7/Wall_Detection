# Welcome to My ROS2 Learning Journey ðŸš€

Hi Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Arpit**, and Iâ€™ve recently started diving deep into **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)**. This repository is where I will document everything I learn along the way â€” including concepts, code snippets, explanations, and personal notes written in simple and beginner-friendly language.

## About Me

I have prior experience working with **ROS1**, specifically using **SLAM (gmapping)** techniques with the **ZED 2i stereo camera**. I participated in **IRC 2025**, where I gained hands-on experience in autonomous navigation and robot localization.

Now, Iâ€™m shifting focus to **ROS2**, aiming to explore its advanced features and improvements over ROS1, especially in preparation for upcoming robotics competitions like **ERC Remote and ERC Onsite**.

## What Iâ€™ll Cover:

- Fundamental differences between **ROS1** and **ROS2**
- Introduction to **DDS (Data Distribution Service)** â€” the core communication layer in ROS2
- Understanding **QoS (Quality of Service)** settings and how they impact ROS2 communication
- My hands-on experiments and projects using ROS2

Further detailed explanations can be found in:

- `ros1 vs ros2.md`
- `QoS.md`
- `DDS.md`
- And many more files to come!

## Why ROS2?

ROS2 brings a lot of enhancements over ROS1, such as:

- Better real-time performance
- Native support for multi-robot systems
- Improved security and communication middleware (DDS)
- Flexible and customizable **QoS policies**

## Stay Tuned!

Iâ€™ll be updating this repo regularly as I progress. Feel free to star ðŸŒŸ and follow if you're interested in learning ROS2 alongside me!

Happy Robotics! ðŸ¤–âœ¨
